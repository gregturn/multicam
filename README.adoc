= Java CLI project template

Probably the fastest way to bootstrap a *Java* Command Line Application (**CLI**) project!

Click the big green _Use This Template_ button and start building your own CLI.

== ü§© Highlights

* uses https://picocli.info/[Picocli] for simple and elegant commands implementation
* builds to an *executable jar* and *GraalVM Native Image*
* preconfigured `help` and `version` commands
* uses *Maven* as a build tool
* *no frameworks* like Spring, Micronaut or Quarkus

== üõ† Requirements

* GraalVM distribution of Java (easy to install with https://sdkman.io/)

== ü§î How to use

Run tests &amp; build an executable JAR:

----
$ ./mvnw package

----

Run tests as native image &amp; build a native executable:

----
$ ./mvnw package -Pnative

----

Run application through Maven

----
